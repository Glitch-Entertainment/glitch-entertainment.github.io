title: About Us

Glitch Entertainment is a small team working to create amazing stories and beautiful worlds like no other. If you want a tl;dr for all that you're probably not going to read, **we are Glitch and we are here to make some cool games.** That being said, it may be important to say we gave one guy too much freedom in writing these blurbs.

## Who We Are
- **We are people who â™¥ Open Source.** Open-source software helps fuel our work and empowers our games to be amazing. We give back to the community by open-sourcing some of our work, such as our game SDKs and this website. You can view all our [licensing here](/licenses).
- **We are creative and talented people.** Our team is, put in the best way to not feed anyone's egos, amazing. We give our games 110% of our effort and ensure they are nurtured into being amazing experiences that will want you to keep coming back for more.
- **We are welcoming.** Frankly, we couldn't care less about your background (unless you're a certified bad guy, then we'd care a little bit). We appreciate everyone who's on our team and/or who contributes to our open-source projects.
- **We are challenging the industry.** Just like our name, we are a glitch in the gaming industry. We pride ourselves on being different from big name studios from doing as little as supporting the open-source community to as big as being open, transparent, and respecting the end-user's privacy.
